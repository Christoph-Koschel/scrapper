# Overview

Introducing the Scrapper program, the ultimate solution for organizing and creating project structures. With Scrapper,
you can easily save an entire folder and its contents under a unique name for later use.

Whether you're having the same folder structure multiply times in a project or you need to archive a project,
Scrapper makes it easy to keep track of your files.
Simply open a command prompt in a folder you want to save and enter.

```terminal
$ scrapper build <name>
```

Later on, when you need to extract those files again, simply loads it content by its name with the load command.
The program will instantly restore all the files and subfolders to the new location. Note that already existing files
will be overwritten.

With Scrapper, you'll never have to create the same structure over and over again.
Try it out today and see how it can revolutionize the way you organize and access your files!
